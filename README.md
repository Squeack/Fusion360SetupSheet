# Fusion360SetupSheet
Fusion 360 personal edition no longer allows production of a setup sheet giving the stock size, tool list and operation summary. This script provides replacement functionality, although without the pretty pictures.

To install, put the .py and .manifest files in a local directory. Under Fusion360 go to Manufacture workspace, Utilities, Add-Ins, Scripts and Add-Ins, then click on the green pls next to My Scripts. Navigate to the local directory where the files were saved and click OK.

You may also need a local copy of the Dumper post processor. Under Manage Post Library find the processor (Title: Autodesk, Description:Dumper), right click and select Export. Save it in the default directory (...username\Appdata\Roaming\Autodesk\Fusion 360 CAM\Posts).
